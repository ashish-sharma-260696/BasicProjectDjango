# BasicProjectDjango
It is an extension of my last project. I am not good with CSS, so I have applied basic styles to my fonts and anchor tag to keep it simple. I have combined all the topics which I have covered so far in my blogs like:  1.) Creating project and application 2.) Managing URLS 3.) Using templates 4.) Including static files
